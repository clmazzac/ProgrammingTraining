## Installing Software
Our programming will be done through Java and VSCode, but if you have another IDE you want to use, you can talk to Michael Yu on Basecamp or find him in person. Additionally, we will be using Github and Git for version control. We will also be using some tools from other teams like AdvantageScope and Pathplanner.
